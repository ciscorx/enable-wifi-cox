These are a few scripts I use to turn on and off the panoramic wifi modem/router provided by the Cox ISP.
Use the make command to compile the associated c scripts used for marking up screen shots produced by the debugging process in making it easier to line up screen shots to gui objects and to find their md5 patterns.

The following scripts work on my raspberry pi 64:
enable-wifi-cox-chrome_on_r4pi64.sh
enable-wifi-cox-vivaldi_on_r4pi64.sh
status-wifi-cox-chrome.sh


The following work on my raspberry pi 32bit:
enable-wifi-cox-vivaldi_on_r4pi32.sh
status-wifi-cox-vivaldi_on_r4pi.sh

The following on tinkerboard S:
enable-wifi-cox-chrome_on_tinkerboard_s.sh
status-wifi-cox-chrome.sh
